## Install

```sh
$ npm i gulp-windowed
```

## Usage

The following example concatenates groups of 5 markdown files. If `src/posts`
contains files `post0.md` through `post99.md`, then the next pipe would receive
a stream containing `page0.md` through `page19.md`, where `page0.md` is the
concatenation of `post0.md` through `post4.md`. The ordering is guaranteed by
the use of [gulp-sort](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sort).

```js
import gulp from 'gulp'
import sort from 'gulp-sorted'
import { windowed } from 'gulp-windowed'
import concat from 'gulp-concat'

const run = () =>
  gulp
    .src('src/posts/*.md') // Posts in markdown
    .pipe(sort()) // Sorted by filename
    .pipe(
      windowed(
        5,
        (
          files,
          i // In groups of 5
        ) => files.pipe(concat(`page${i}.md`)) // Concatenated into one page where 'i' is the window number
      )
    ) // More pipes...
```

Here it is used to split groups of files into different folders:

```js
import gulp from 'gulp'
import { windowed } from 'gulp-windowed'
import rename from 'gulp-rename'

const run = () =>
  gulp.src('src/*').pipe(
    windowed(10, (files, i, done) =>
      files.pipe(
        rename({
          dirname: `folder${i}`
        })
      )
    )
  ) // More pipes...
```

Here it is used to skip every other file:

```js
import gulp from 'gulp'
import { windowed } from 'gulp-windowed'

const run = () =>
  gulp
    .src('src/*')
    .pipe(windowed(1, (files, i, done) => (i % 2 === 0 ? files : done()))) // More pipes...
```

Notice that the stream of `File` objects in the callback can be returned from
the callback. They are subsequently written to the resulting stream for the next
pipe _outside_ the callback. This is useful because it allows you to perform
stream operations on the groups of files, while also allowing you to merge the
resulting streams back together to continue performing operations.

If you'd like an array of `File` objects instead of a stream then import and
call `arrayWindowed` instead.

## API

`windowed(n, cb) -> DuplexObjectStream<File>`

Calls `cb` with a readable object stream (or array for `arrayWindowed`)
containing `n` [vinyl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vinyl) `File` objects each
time `n` are written to it. On stream end if there are any remaining `File`
objects because the `n` threshold was not met then `cb` is called with a
readable object stream (or array for `arrayWindowed`) containing the remaining
[0, `n`) `File` objects. The contents of the duplex object stream returned by
the method depends on `cb` (explained below).

Parameters:

- `n` : `int` - A number of `File` objects to include per window. Must be a
  positive integer.
- `cb` :
  `(files, i, done) -> File | Array<File> | Promise<File | Array<File> | *> | Observable<File | Array<File> | *> | ChildProcess | ReadableObjectStream<File> | undefined` -
  A callback which either calls `done` or returns a `File` object, an array of
  `File` objects, or an asynchronous operation in some returnable format (see
  possible `cb` return types and
  [async-done](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-done)). If an asynchronous
  operation is returned it will be resolved. If the result of `cb`, through
  calling `done` or returning an asynchronous operation, is a `File` object or
  an array of `File` objects then they will be written to the duplex object
  stream returned from `windowed`.
  - `files` : `ReadableObjectStream<File> | Array<File>` - A readable object
    stream (or array for `window.array`) containing up to `n`
    [vinyl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vinyl) `File` objects (see above from
    why not exactly `n`).
  - `i` : `int` - The current zero-based window number (i.e. the number of times
    `cb` has been called minus one).
  - `done` : `(err, result) -> undefined` - Call `done(new Error(...))` for
    error or `done(null, result)` for success when performing asynchronous
    operations in non-returnable format or when performing strictly synchronous
    operations. This method does not need to be and should not be called if a
    valid value of the types mentioned above is returned from `cb`.
